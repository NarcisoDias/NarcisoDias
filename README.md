- 👋 Hi, I’m @NarcisoDias,
- 👀 I’m interested in _**Coding, analysis and system development, continued learning and cyber security.
-    #A brief history about me:
-    ## I was a dentist with 2 specializations and 1 master degree in the field. Was a university professor for about 2 years, was a clinical dentist for about 8 years, and I reached the top of my career. So, I had nowhere else to keep growing. 
-    Then, I felt a need to change direction. A tech lover as I'm, I decide to take a shot in the development world after almost 13 years in the health area.
-    And now, here I am!       
- 🌱 I’m currently learning analysis and system development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IT teams.
